<h2> Comparing and Contrasting Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Etherium </h2>
<br>
<p>Although bitcoin, dogecoin, and etherium are all cryptocurrencies, they do have similarities and differences. A notable feature for dogecoin and ethereum is that, unlike bitcoin, it does not have a supply limit. Ethereum has a blockchain that is meant to work with many applications while Bitcoin’s blockchain is bitcoin specific. Both ethereum and bitcoin’s networks consume vast amounts of energy.</p>

<p>When viewing this graph there is a decent amount comovement. We can say this because there are times where all 3 lines overlap, but there are times where the correlation lines are trending in a different direction.</p>

<br>
<p>Of the currencies, bitcoin and ethereum are the most volatile/risky. As for a pattern, there are conspicuous peak and troughs. When spotting patterns that determine the volatility as a function of time, it is difficult to make any assumptions based off this graph. It is likely that there are geopolitical events that could be influencing this. To understand the volatility, we would need to align the peaks and troughs with events at that time. </p>

<h2> Spread by Coin</h2>
<p>As for the spread, when I pulled the data, the spread for bitcoin, dogecoin, and ethereum were respectively: $54.31, $0.00028, and $3.57. The spread relative to the average price of each coin is almost negligible. As for the implications, a cryptocurrency trader will likely not be using price as a differentiator when choosing a market to trade from. </p>
